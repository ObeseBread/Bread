don't look in the mirror,
look into my eyes...
when you see your reflection,
you'll see what I like...
you look good, in the mornin'
and you don't, even know it...

I got this feeling on a summer day,
knew it when I saw her face...
I just thought that SHE, COULD, BE, THE ONE.

sundress with you on my arm,
take the coupe out the garage
pull the roof back just me, you and the stars...
toast to the gods.
